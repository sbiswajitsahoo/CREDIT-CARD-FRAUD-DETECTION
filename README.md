## Lessons learnt:
* How and when to use Logistic Regression?
* How to balance dataset?
* How to perform statistical analysis?
* How to deploy a machine learning model using Flask?

## What to do next?
* Create a better looking web UI.
* Use other models instead of Logistic Regression and compare the accuracy scores.
